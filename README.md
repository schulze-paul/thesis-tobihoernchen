Master Thesis on Reinforcement Learning with Anylogic

## Installation

For the Python part, just run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. 

You can get Anylogic from their [website](https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/). Any version works, but there are limitations to some versions as stated in the [Alpyne docs](https://t-wolfeadam.github.io/Alpyne/_build/html/intro_getstarted.html).

JRE is also required, CUDA might be useful.

If you plan to work with certain libraries in Anylogic (like Material Handling), be aware that depending on the Anylogic version you might be required to move some .jar files. The procedure is described in the corresponding [issue on github](https://github.com/t-wolfeadam/Alpyne/issues/18).
